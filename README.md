# BMP2 sensor API

### Sensor overview

BMP2 is an absolute barometric pressure sensor especially designed for mobile applications.
The sensor module is housed in an extremely compact package. 
Its small dimensions and its low power consumption allow the implementation in battery driven devices such as 
mobile phones, GPS modules or watches. 
BMP2 is based on Bosch's proven Piezo-resistive pressure sensor technology featuring high accuracy and linearity as 
well as long term stability and high EMC robustness.
